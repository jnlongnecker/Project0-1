# Project0
Don't zip your project, that defeats the whole purpose of Git when I have to download and unzip the code in order to see it or work with it.

I was able to find testing for only a single class, although it looks as if test classes had been created for more, just never written. Make sure to follow best practices and keep your triggers logicless and test all classes and their methods thoroughly.
